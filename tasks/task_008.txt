# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement User Input Processing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the logic to handle both button-based choices and free-text user inputs for story progression.
# Details:
- Implement handlers for button choice selection
- Create logic for processing free-text user inputs
- Develop input validation and sanitization
- Create a unified interface for processing both types of inputs
- Implement logic to format user inputs for the LLM API
- Add support for special commands (e.g., help, restart)

# Test Strategy:
Test with various input types including edge cases. Verify both button choices and free text inputs produce coherent story continuations. Test input validation with potentially problematic inputs.
