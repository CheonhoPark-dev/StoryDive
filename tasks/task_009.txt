# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Story Flow Loop
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the main application loop that handles the story progression cycle from display to user input to next story segment.
# Details:
- Implement the core story loop:
  * Display story segment
  * Show generated choices
  * Accept user input (choice or text)
  * Process input
  * Generate next story segment
  * Repeat
- Add state management to track story progress
- Implement error recovery to handle API failures
- Add basic analytics to track user interactions

# Test Strategy:
Conduct end-to-end testing of the complete story flow. Verify the loop continues properly after multiple interactions. Test error recovery by simulating API failures.
