# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Story Generation Logic
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core logic for generating story continuations based on user choices and maintaining story context.
# Details:
- Create a story manager module that:
  * Maintains the current story state and history
  * Formats prompts for the Gemini Flash API
  * Processes API responses into readable story segments
  * Extracts or generates 2-4 choices from API responses
  * Handles context window limitations
- Implement logic to combine user choices with story context
- Create functions to format story text for display

# Test Strategy:
Test with various user inputs and choices to ensure coherent story generation. Verify context management works correctly for longer stories. Check that choices are relevant to the current story context.
